				<p class="title">Trouble</a></p>
				<p>This project has a special place in my heart because it was the 
				first major project I completed that didn't amount to copying code 
				out of a book. Created before I was introduced to the concept of 
				objects, it is the epitome of humble beginnings. The challenge
				of creating a black-and-white version of a board game that is highly
				dependent on color (in ASCII art no less) was substantial, and
				because of that this remains one of my favorite programs.</p>

				<p class="title">Hunt the Wumpus</a></p>
				<p>Hunt the Wumpus is a well-known text-adventure game that tasks
				players with tracking a dangerous beast through a system of caves.
				In my object-oriented programming class, I was tasked with recreating
				it in C++. This was my first experience using objects, and I'm very
				happy with the result. So happy in fact that I decided to recreate
				the game with graphics in order to learn more about the SDL graphics
				library (see below).</p>

				<p class="title">Super Star Trek</a></p>
				<p>This remains the hardest project I have completed. A
				remake of Super Star Trek which intends to be as faithful
				as possible, this project forced me to better understand
				the concepts behind object-oriented programming. It was also
				the first project that was large enough to show me how
				important the design phase of the software engineering
				process.</p>

				<p class="title">Roguelike</a></p>
				<p>Roguelike is a simple top down RPG style game featuring
				elements of randomization and character progression.
				It features a fully realized inventory system, punishing 
				enemy AI, and a save-game function implemented with SQLite.</p>
				<p>My earlier assignments had allowed me to work with a
				partner, but this assignment was my first opportunity to
				work with a larger team of seven classmates. I served
				as the team manager and am very happy with the work 
				we accomplished. This represents our first usage of
				an external libraries (Curses) and our first use of
				version control utilities (Git and Github).</p>

				<p>Part of an operating systems design course, this project
				served as both a way to learn more about the way an operating
				system manages memory and as a lesson in the beauty and agony
				of linked lists. The user can choose between first-fit and worst-fit
				allocation algorithms and can enable or disable compaction and 
				coalescence.</p>

				<p class="title">Android Restaurant App</p>
				<p>This app was another project which involved collaboration with the whole class. 
				Our task was to create an ordering, seating, and point-of-sale system for a (fictiona) 
				local restaurant. We met with our 'client', solicited requirements, and split into three 
				teams: Android (who wrote code for handheld devices), Swing (who wrote code using the Swing
				library for customer terminals and POS devices), and Networking (responsible for communication
				between all devices and storing data in a relational database. I was part of the Networking
				team and personally wrote code for our server and coordinated work between with the other teams.</p>
				
				<p>This assignment was treated as real-life example of the software design process, and as such
				we were required to produce all the relevant paperwork such as proposals and design documents.
				Examples of this are linked here in addition to the code.

				<p>My college assembly course provided us with many small
				programs with which to learn the language, but this Fibonacci Generator
				program was the most noteable and fully-featured. The program generates
				numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, allowing to user to choose the first
				two numbers in the sequence and the number of values to generate.</p>

				<p class="title">HTML/CSS - Resume Website</a></p>
				<p>This website was developed and is maintained by myself.
				I'm not a graphical designer, so it's not the
				most flashy site on the web, but it serves its purpose well
				enough. More interestingly, this website is hosted on a
				Raspberry Pi, and I've written an article intended to guide
				others through the process of buying and configuring their
				Raspberry Pi with Rasbian Linux, turning it into a web
				server that can host Ruby On Rails applications, and finally
				connecting it to a domain name and publishing it online.
				The tutorial is linked below.

				<p class="title">Sportsfan Database - HTML/CSS/MySQL</a></p>
				<p>This project was completed as part of a database design course.
				The web pages that host the data were created to be presented to
				a class, so they are a bit oversimplified. This project was my
				first experience with MySQL and I believe it served	as a great 
				introduction to the proper design and creation of a	relational database.</p>
