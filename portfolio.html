				<h3>Encrypted Text Editor</h3>
				<p class="portfolioDescription">Small project to refresh my Java knowledge and to learn some 
				things about encryption. This very simple program functions as a basic text-editor that allows 
				users to save and load text files and encrypt and decrypt them using a password.</p>
				<p class="language">Languages used: Java<br>
				Concepts explored: Swing, AES encryption, exception handling, Javadoc</p>

				<h3>Work in Progress - World Crisis Map</h3>
				<p class="portfolioDescription">Currently a WIP, this website started as a simple testbed to 
				learn some things about Javascript. It is intended to be a dynamically updating map of world 
				crises (natural disasters, epidemics, conflicts,etc) powered by data scraped from various web sources. 
				It will one day contain links to information about the disasters facing various countries along 
				with a link to charity websites for the selected crisis.</p>
				<p class="language">Languages used: Javascript/Ajax, PHP/SQL and HTML/CSS<br>
				Concepts explored: Google Maps Javascript API, JSON/GEOJSON, XML, KML, DOM, and webscraping</p>

				<h3>Trouble</h3>
				<p class="portfolioDescription">This project has a special place in my heart because it was the 
				first major project I completed that didn't amount to copying code 
				out of a book. Created before I was introduced to the concept of 
				objects, it is the epitome of humble beginnings. The challenge
				of creating a black-and-white version of a board game that is highly
				dependent on color (in ASCII art no less) was substantial, and
				because of that this remains one of my favorite programs.</p>
				<p class="language">Languages used: C++<br>
				Concepts explored: Structural programming. </p>

				<h3>Hunt the Wumpus</h3>
				<p class="portfolioDescription">Hunt the Wumpus is a well-known text-adventure game that tasks
				players with tracking a dangerous beast through a system of caves.
				In my object-oriented programming class, I was tasked with recreating
				it in C++. This was my first experience using objects, and I'm very
				happy with the result. So happy in fact that I decided to recreate
				the game with graphics in order to learn more about the SDL graphics
				library (see below).</p>
				<p class="language">Languages used: C++ <br>
				Concepts explored: Object-Oriented Programming </p>

				<h3>Super Star Trek</h3>
				<p class="portfolioDescription">This remains the hardest project I have completed. A
				remake of Super Star Trek which intends to be as faithful
				as possible, this project forced me to better understand
				the concepts behind object-oriented programming. It was also
				the first project that was large enough to show me how
				important the design phase of the software engineering
				process.</p>
				<p class="language">Languages used: C++<br>
				Concepts explored: Object-Oriented Programming </p>

				<h3>Roguelike</h3>
				<p class="portfolioDescription">Roguelike is a simple top down 
				RPG style game featuring elements of randomization and 
				character progression. It features a fully realized inventory 
				system, punishing enemy AI, and a save-game function implemented 
				with SQLite.</p>
				<p class="portfolioDescription">My earlier assignments had 
				allowed me to work with a
				partner, but this assignment was my first opportunity to
				work with a larger team of seven classmates. I served
				as the team manager and am very happy with the work 
				we accomplished. This represents our first usage of
				an external libraries (Curses) and our first use of
				version control utilities (Git and Github).</p>
				<p class="language">Languages used: C++ (w/Curses library)<br>
				Concepts explored: Version control (Git/Github), Object-Oriented design </p>

				<h3>Memory Manager</h3>
				<p class="portfolioDescription">Part of an operating systems design course, this project
				served as both a way to learn more about the way an operating
				system manages memory and as a lesson in the beauty and agony
				of linked lists. The user can choose between first-fit and worst-fit
				allocation algorithms and can enable or disable compaction and 
				coalescence.</p>
				<p class="language">Languages used: C++<br>
				Concepts explored: Linked-lists, first-fit/worst-fit algorithms </p>

				<h3>Android Restaurant App</h3>
				<p class="portfolioDescription">This app was another project 
				which involved collaboration with the whole class. Our task was 
				to create an ordering, seating, and point-of-sale system for a 
				(fictional) local restaurant. We met with our 'client', solicited 
				requirements, and split into three teams: Android, Swing, and 
				Networking. I was part of the Networking team and personally 
				wrote code for our server and coordinated work between with 
				the other teams.</p>				
				<p class="portfolioDescription">This assignment was treated as 
				real-life example of the software design process, and as such
				we were required to produce all the relevant paperwork such 
				as proposals and design documents. Examples of this are linked 
				here in addition to the code.</p>
				<p class="language">Languages used: Java (Swing library)<br>
				Concepts explored: Android design, networking sockets, JSON, documentation, client communication </p>

				<h3>Sportsfan Database</h3>
				<p class="portfolioDescription">This project was completed 
				as part of a database design course. The web pages that host 
				the data were created to be presented to a class, so they are 
				a bit oversimplified. This project was my first experience with
				MySQL and I believe it served as a great introduction to the
				proper design and creation of a	relational database.</p>
				<p class="language">Languages used: HTML, CSS, MySQL and PHP<br>
				Concepts explored: Relational database design</p>

				<h3>Concord Course Search</h3>
				<p class="portfolioDescription">This project uses Ruby on Rails and MySQL 
				to scrape data from Concord	University's Seats Taken page and allow users to 
				search class data by semester as far back as 1999.</p>
				<p class="language">Languages used: Ruby/Ruby on Rails framework, HTML, CSS, MySQL<br>
				Concepts explored: Web-scraping, Model-View-Controller architecture, Ruby on Rails hosting with Apache</p>

				<h3>Representative Tracker</h3>
				<p class="portfolioDescription">This is a personal project undertaken by 
				myself to begin learning the .net framework. This project has provided a wealth 
				of knowledge in regards to APIs and dynamic web page creation. The site is
				designed to be highly user-friendly and is targeted towards those
				who want a simple and fast way to see what their politicians have been doing.</p>
				<p class="language">Languages used: .Net Framework (C# MVC), HTML and CSS<br>
				Concepts explored: Responsive design, Web APIs, Model-View-Controller architecture</p>

				<h3>Fibonacci Generator</h3>
				<p class="portfolioDescription">My college assembly course provided 
				us with many small programs with which to learn the language, but this 
				Fibonacci Generator	program was the most noteable and fully-featured. 
				The program generates numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, allowing to 
				user to choose the first two numbers in the sequence and the number of 
				values to generate.</p>
				<p class="language">Languages used: x86 Assembly<br>
				Concepts explored: Bit manipulation</p>

				<h3>Resume Website</h3>
				<p class="portfolioDescription">This website is developed and 
				maintained by myself. I'm not a graphical designer, so it's not the
				most visually astounding site on the web, but it provides a valuable 
				testbed for various web-related projects as well as an archive of my 
				older projects.
				<!--More interestingly, this website is hosted on a
				Raspberry Pi, and I've written an article intended to guide
				others through the process of buying and configuring their
				Raspberry Pi with Rasbian Linux, turning it into a web
				server that can host Ruby On Rails applications, and finally
				connecting it to a domain name and publishing it online.
				The tutorial is linked below.--></p>
				<p class="language">Languages used: HTML and CSS<br>
				Concepts explored: Responsive design, Rasbperry Pi, web hosting with LAMP stack, Debian Linux</p>
