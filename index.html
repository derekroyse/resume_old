				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p> 
					I am a developer with experience developing and maintaining large-scale 
					web applications. I'm currently seeking	a remote entry/mid level developer position. 
					I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Information Systems with a focus 
					on object-oriented programming, and a year of professional experience in 
					web development with Coldfusion, PHP, and Javascript/JQuery.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>	
					Outside of my professional experience, I've	also used .Net, Django, and Ruby on Rails to 
					create projects in my spare time. I am capable of quickly learning new languages and 
					technologies and pride myself in being an efficient self-directed worker. I love Python 
					and Django,	and I'm currently focused on going deeper with that framework and 
					hosting with AWS. I am also interested in cybersecurity and I'm currently studying for
					my second certification in that field.
